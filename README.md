Survival and Collapse of Historical States: Analysis Based on the MOROS Dataset

Objective

This project aims to analyze the formation, survival, and collapse patterns of historical states across ~5,000 years, drawing on the MOROS (Mortality of States) dataset as described in:

‚ÄúLoss of Resilience in Aging Societies‚Äù
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), 2023
DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2218834120

The project explores questions such as:
	‚Ä¢	What is the typical lifespan of a state?
	‚Ä¢	How does collapse risk evolve as a state ages?
	‚Ä¢	How do geography and political type affect state survival?
	‚Ä¢	What are the common causes of state collapse?

Datasets

Table1.csv

Simplified export of the core variables from the MOROS dataset:
	‚Ä¢	Society_Polity: Name of the polity or state
	‚Ä¢	formation: State formation date (year)
	‚Ä¢	collapse: State collapse date (year)
	‚Ä¢	age: Lifespan of the polity (years)
	‚Ä¢	NaturalGeoArea: Geographic region
	‚Ä¢	quasi_polity: Boolean flag (True = quasi-state)

‚Üí Ideal for reproducing PNAS paper analyses:
Kaplan-Meier survival curves, hazard functions, lifespan distributions.

Table2.csv

Extended dataset of 731 states/polities with additional detail:
	‚Ä¢	Formation, collapse, lifespan
	‚Ä¢	Political type and subtype
	‚Ä¢	Region, continent
	‚Ä¢	Collapse causes (Proximate_Cause, Underlying_Cause)
	‚Ä¢	Capital locations and coordinates
	‚Ä¢	Additional variables (e.g. violience_attractor)

‚Üí Enables richer exploratory analysis:
	‚Ä¢	Political type comparison
	‚Ä¢	Geospatial mapping of state survival
	‚Ä¢	Analysis of collapse causes
	‚Ä¢	Temporal trends in state formation/collapse

Planned Analyses

1Ô∏è‚É£ Descriptive Analysis
	‚Ä¢	Distribution of state lifespans (age)
	‚Ä¢	Temporal trends in state formation/collapse
	‚Ä¢	Compare lifespans across political types and regions

2Ô∏è‚É£ Survival Analysis (core replication of PNAS)
	‚Ä¢	Kaplan-Meier survival curves
	‚Ä¢	Fit parametric hazard functions (lognormal, Gompertz, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Compare survival probabilities by political type, geography

3Ô∏è‚É£ Geographic Visualization
	‚Ä¢	Map state capitals and visualize lifespan
	‚Ä¢	Analyze spatial patterns in state formation/collapse

4Ô∏è‚É£ Collapse Cause Analysis (Table2)
	‚Ä¢	Explore frequency of collapse causes
	‚Ä¢	Relate causes to political type, region, lifespan

5Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Modeling
	‚Ä¢	Sensitivity of results to inclusion/exclusion of quasi-polities
	‚Ä¢	Time-windowed analysis (does average lifespan change over centuries?)
	‚Ä¢	Potential to explore loss of resilience trends as in the PNAS paper
